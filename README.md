dataHackathon
=============
Unfortunately my team didn't know how to integrate the back end with this simple html and css, so we didn't actually used it.
I tried to changed at least the css files of the functional demo (most of their work), that we didn't get to show. http://tripplanner.cloudapp.net/
We presented an invision prototype in the 3 min presentation. http://invis.io/HW1D1X1TD
My team and I were new to hackathons, they had never worked with a designer before and they didn't really listened to me.
I had never worked with bak end developers before, I didn't know how to communicate effectively with them.
I assumed they new front end too, they didn't. They assumed I didn't know anything about code, they were wrong.
Nevertheless, we learned a lot from each other. 

Lesson learnt.
